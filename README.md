Dear colleagues,
It is our pleasure to invite you to participate in POSMOL 2025.
The conference will be held in Matsue, Japan, on August 8-10, 2025, starting with the Welcome Reception on Thursday evening August 7, 2025.
The POSMOL will continue this year as a joint meeting of the International Workshop on Low-Energy Positron and Positronium Physics and the International Symposium on Electron-Molecule Collisions and Swarms. It is a satellite meeting of the [International Conference on Photonic, Electronic, and Atomic Collisions (ICPEAC 2025)](https://www.icpeac2025.jp/) to be held in Sapporo, Japan from July 29 to August 5, 2025.
The POSMOL conference covers a wide range of research topics related to positron, electron, positronium, and antimatter interactions with particles, atoms, molecules, and complex systems, and related subjects. The meeting will continue the tradition of a scientific forum at which a diverse group of scholars from around the world will have an opportunity to share their theoretical and experimental findings, ideas, innovations, and methodologies through formal and informal discussions to advance scientific knowledge and understanding of the fundamental, collisional interactions.
